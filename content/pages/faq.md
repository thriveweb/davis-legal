    Robert accepts briefs to appear in courts all Australian states and territories. He accepts briefs both paper and electronic format. Electronic briefs may be delivered either by email or on USB or other media via his PO Box. PDF format is preferred. Paper briefs are to be addressed to his Post Office box. Please allow appropriate time for delivery of all hard-copy mail communications.

    Robert will confer with clients in the offices of their solicitor and when he works interstate does so on a fly-in-fly-out basis. Robert only accepts briefs for clients via their solicitor.

    He does not accept briefs direct from the public. This is because pre-trial litigation work is complex, labour intensive, and requires the the attention of an experienced solicitor. No work will be commenced by Robert (unless urgent) until appropriate agreement is reached about the terms of his retainer. Cost estimates are available upon request.

    In appropriate cases Robert is willing work on a deferred or conditional basis. It is often necessary to review the brief before any cost estimate can be made. In large, complex or urgent matters he may require some payment for perusal of the brief before considering alternate cost arrangements. Before sending a brief you should phone Robert to discuss the matter and confirm his availability.

  - title: What is a barrister?
    content: >-
      A barrister is a legal practitioner who elects to practice as a specialist advocate in courts. Barristers must undertake special training before they can become members of their Bar Association. The word barrister refers to someone who has been “called to the bar” and who then becomes a “barrister-at-law".
  - title: How does a barrister differ from a solicitor?
    content: >-
      Solicitors and barristers are both legal professionals who are permitted to appear in courts. Most solicitors spend their careers performing transactional work for clients, such as property transfers, drawing wills, preparing contracts, etc.

      Litigation solicitors mostly prepare cases and then brief a barrister to appear at court on their client's behalf. Solicitors also brief barristers to advise their clients on specialist areas of legal knowledge. Solicitors often work in law firms and may choose to only represent special categories of client.

      In contrast, barristers are required to work only as sole traders and are ethically bound (subject to agreement being reached as to their costs) to accept briefs on behalf of any client.
  - title: How do barristers charge?
    content: >-
      Barristers costs will vary depending on the nature of the work required, their special expertise, and their seniority. Barristers charge costs that are either based on the time spent or, on occasion, a fixed cost on brief.

      Barristers are required to disclose their costs before commencing work. If urgent work is required before a cost
      disclosure can be made, then the barrister must make a disclosure at the earliest opportunity. A barrister is (usually) not to perform any work for a client unless a cost agreement has first been reached.

      Barristers are sometimes willing to work on a deferred payment basis. Other barristers may be willing to work on a conditional basis - that is - where payment depends wholly or partly upon success in the case.
  - title: Do I also need a solicitor?
    content: >-
      Some barristers are willing to accept direct briefs from the public. This usually occurs with barristers conducting criminal work in lower courts. Many (probably most) barristers will only accept client briefs via a solicitor's firm. Litigation work is often very complex and labour intensive. Barristers must work as sole traders so they lack the human and other resources that a solicitors firm can devote to pre-trial paperwork. Robert only accepts briefs via a solicitor.
  - title: How do I employ a barrister?
    content: >-
      If you are a member of the public and wish to directly engage a barrister then you should phone around to find someone who is suitable. If you already have a solicitor then he or she will advise you about which barristers are best suited to your circumstances. You can carry out your own research into the barristers suggested, but your solicitor is often the best source of information in this regard.
