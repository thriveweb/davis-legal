    Robert accepts briefs to appear in courts in all Australian States and
    Territories. He accepts briefs both paper and electronic format. 


    Electronic briefs may be delivered either by email or on USB or other media
    via his PO Box. PDF format is preferred. Paper briefs are to be addressed to
    his Post Office box. Please allow appropriate time for delivery of all
    hard-copy mail communications.


    Robert will confer with clients in the offices of their solicitor and, when
    he works interstate, does so on a fly-in-fly-out basis. 


    Robert only accepts briefs for clients via their solicitor. He does not
    accept briefs direct from the public. 


    This is because pre-trial litigation work is complex and often quite labour
    intensive.
  rightColumn: >-
    It is usually more cost effective if much of the pre-trial litigation work
    to be performed by an experienced solicitor - with input from the barrister
    if necessary. 


    No work will be commenced by Robert (unless urgent) until appropriate
    agreement is reached about the terms of his retainer. 


    Cost estimates are available upon request.  In appropriate cases Robert is
    willing work on a deferred or conditional basis. It is often necessary to
    review the brief before any cost estimate can be made. 


    In large, complex or urgent matters he may require some payment for perusal
    of the brief before considering alternate cost arrangements. 


    Before sending a brief you should phone Robert to discuss the matter and
    confirm his availability.

      A barrister is a qualified lawyer who elects to practice as a specialist
      advocate in courts. 


      Australian barristers must undertake further post-admission training
      before they can become members of a Bar Association and act as
      barristers. 


      The word barrister refers to someone who has been “called to the bar” and
      who then becomes a “barrister-at-law".
    title: What is a barrister?
  - content: >-
      Solicitors and barristers are both qualified legal professionals
      (lawyers).  


      Most solicitors will spend their careers performing transactional work for
      clients, such as property transfers, drawing wills, preparing contracts,
      etc. While some solicitors regularly appear in lower courts, they will
      usually employ barristers to represent their clients in higher courts or
      in more complex cases. 


      Solicitors mostly prepare cases for their clients and then brief a
      barrister to appear at court on their client's behalf. Solicitors also
      regularly brief barristers to advise their clients on specialist areas of
      legal knowledge. 


      Solicitors often work in law firms and may choose to only represent only
      special categories of client. 


      Some solicitors work mainly for corporate entities (such as insurers,
      manufacturers, employers, or government authorities etc). Others will work
      mainly for members of the general public. Most suburban solicitors will
      fall within the latter category.


      In contrast to solicitors, barristers are ethically required (subject to
      agreement being reached as to their costs) to use their skill and training
      as advocates on behalf of _any_ client. This is called the "cab rank
      rule".
    title: How does a barrister differ from a solicitor?
  - content: >-
      Barristers costs will vary depending on the nature of the work required,
      their special expertise, and their seniority. 


      Barristers charge costs that are either based on the time spent or, on
      occasion, a fixed cost on brief. Barristers (like all lawyers) are
      required to disclose their costs before commencing work. 


      If urgent work is required before a cost disclosure can be made, then the
      barrister must make a disclosure at the earliest opportunity. 


      A barrister is (usually) not to perform any work for a client unless a
      cost agreement has first been reached. 


      Many barristers are willing to work on a deferred payment basis. Some
      barristers are also willing to work on a conditional basis - that is -
      where payment depends wholly or partly upon success in the case.
    title: How do barristers charge?
  - content: >-
      Some barristers are willing to accept direct briefs from the public. 


      This usually occurs with barristers conducting criminal work in lower
      courts. Family law barristers will also often accept direct briefs.


      Barristers who conduct larger and more complex cases will only rarely
      accept direct briefs from the public. 


      Large and complex cases require a lot of pre-trial preparation. 


      This preparatory work is usually best performed by experienced solicitors
      who may, cost effectively, also delegate some aspects of the preparation
      to more junior legal employees. 


      Because barristers must work as sole traders they lack the human and other
      resources that a solicitor's firm can devote to pre-trial paperwork. 


      Robert only accepts briefs via a solicitor.
    title: Do I also need a solicitor?
  - content: >-
      If you are a member of the public and wish to directly engage a barrister
      then you should phone around to find someone who is suitable. 


      If you already have a solicitor then he or she will advise you about which
      barristers are best suited to your circumstances. 


      You can carry out your own research into the barristers suggested, but
      your solicitor is often the best source of information in this regard.


      Each Bar Association publishes a list of their members on the internet.
