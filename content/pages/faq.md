      A barrister is a specially qualified lawyer who elects to practice as a
      specialist advocate in courts. 


      Australian Barristers must undertake special training before they can
      become members of a Bar Association and act as barristers. 


      The word barrister refers to someone who has been “called to the bar” and
      who then becomes a “barrister-at-law".
    title: What is a barrister?
  - content: >-
      Solicitors and barristers are both qualified legal professionals
      (lawyers).  


      Most solicitors will spend their careers performing transactional work for
      clients, such as property transfers, drawing wills, preparing contracts,
      etc. While some solicitors regularly appear in lower courts, they will
      usually employ barristers to represent their clients in higher courts or
      in more complex cases. 


      Solicitors mostly prepare cases for their clients and then brief a
      barrister to appear at court on their client's behalf. Solicitors also
      regularly brief barristers to advise their clients on specialist areas of
      legal knowledge. 


      Solicitors often work in law firms and may choose to only represent only
      special categories of client. 


      Some solicitors work mainly for corporate entities (such as insurers,
      manufacturers, employers, or government authorities etc). Others will work
      mainly for members of the general public. Most suburban solicitors will
      fall within the latter category.


      In contrast to solicitors, barristers are ethically required (subject to
      agreement being reached as to their costs) to work on behalf of any
      client.
    title: How does a barrister differ from a solicitor?
  - content: >-
      Barristers costs will vary depending on the nature of the work required,
      their special expertise, and their seniority. 


      Barristers charge costs that are either based on the time spent or, on
      occasion, a fixed cost on brief. Barristers are required to disclose their
      costs before commencing work. 


      If urgent work is required before a cost disclosure can be made, then the
      barrister must make a disclosure at the earliest opportunity. 


      A barrister is (usually) not to perform any work for a client unless a
      cost agreement has first been reached. 


      Many barristers are willing to work on a deferred payment basis. Some
      barristers are also willing to work on a conditional basis - that is -
      where payment depends wholly or partly upon success in the case.
    title: How do barristers charge?
  - content: >-
      Some barristers are willing to accept direct briefs from the public. 


      This usually occurs with barristers conducting criminal work in lower
      courts. 


      Many (probably most) barristers will only accept client briefs via a
      solicitor's firm - because pre-trial litigation work is often very labour
      intensive and is therefore best performed by a solicitor. 


      Barristers must work as sole traders so they lack the human and other
      resources that a solicitors firm can devote to pre-trial paperwork. 


      Robert only accepts briefs via a solicitor.
    title: Do I also need a solicitor?
  - content: >-
      If you are a member of the public and wish to directly engage a barrister
      then you should phone around to find someone who is suitable. 


      If you already have a solicitor then he or she will advise you about which
      barristers are best suited to your circumstances. 


      You can carry out your own research into the barristers suggested, but
      your solicitor is often the best source of information in this regard.
